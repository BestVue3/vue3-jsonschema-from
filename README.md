Web Forms never come that easy, Just vue3 component and JsonSchema, you can nearly do everything to build your own form.

If you:

- want to build dynamic form which you try to save the form config into your database
- tried of writting form code by typing every field
- try to build some system which your user can build a form by Drag And Drop

you should try this.

You can play with the [playground]() to get familiar with this lib. Or you may want to read the [doc]() to find out what exactly this lib can do.
